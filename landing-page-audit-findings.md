# Landing Page Marketing Audit - Initial Findings

## Page Structure Observed So Far:

1. **Hero Section**
   - Headline: "You Were Never Meant to Feel This Tired, This Stuck, or This Out of Sync"
   - Subheadline: "Reset your hormones, your metabolism, and your future in just 2 days"
   - Pricing badges: "From $97" and "VIP $197"
   - CTA: "Join the Waitlist Now"
   - Social proof: "247+ women already joined • 33 spots left"
   - Countdown timer: Currently showing 0:0:0:0 (BROKEN)

2. **As Featured In Section**
   - Media logos: Fitness First, 21 Fitness, Cosmopolitan, Health & Fitness, etc.
   - Headline: "Trusted By Leading Media" + "As Featured In"

3. **Meet Your Host Section**
   - Full-width layout with Victoria's image on left
   - Stats: 25+ Years Experience, 17K+ Women Helped, 50+ Media Features
   - Bio copy about Victoria's experience
   - **ISSUE**: Copy says "15 years" but stat shows "25+" - inconsistency

## Initial Issues Identified:

### CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. **Countdown timer broken** - Shows 0:0:0:0, kills urgency
2. **Page length concern** - User reports it's too long
3. **Inconsistent experience years** - Text says 15, stat shows 25+

### REDUNDANCY CONCERNS:
- Multiple "Join the Waitlist" CTAs throughout page
- Need to assess if there's too much repetition

## Next Steps:
- Continue scrolling to document all sections
- Identify redundant sections
- Analyze copy effectiveness
- Review image usage
- Provide consolidation recommendations
