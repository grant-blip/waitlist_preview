## Executive Summary

**Current Status:** The landing page is **TOO LONG** with significant redundancy and conversion friction. Estimated scroll depth: 17,000+ pixels (approximately 12-15 full screens on desktop).

**Critical Finding:** You're losing prospects due to:

### ❌ DELETE (Low Value / Redundant)

**Sections to Remove Completely:**

1. **"Transform Your Health in Just 2 Days" (6 topic boxes)** - Redundant with agenda
2. **"How The Longevity Reset Works" (4 steps)** - Obvious, adds no value
3. **"What Women Are Saying" (3 testimonials)** - Redundant with transformation story
4. **"See Real Transformations" (video placeholders)** - Non-functional placeholders
5. **"Why The Longevity Reset is Different" (6 boxes)** - Generic filler content

**Total Savings:** 2,400-3,000 pixels (approximately 20-25% reduction)

## Copy Issues & Recommendations

### Critical Copy Fixes:

**1. Inconsistent Experience**
- **Issue:** Bio says "15 years" but stat card shows "25+"
- **Fix:** Update bio to say "over 25 years" to match stat

**2. Countdown Timer**
- **Issue:** Shows 0:0:0:0 (broken)
- **Fix:** Set to count down to May 17, 2025 or remove entirely

**3. Weak Transformation Story Headline**
- **Current:** "Sarah is a perimenopausal woman reclaiming her Energy, Vitality & Confidence"
- **Issue:** Third-person, distant, not engaging
- **Recommendation:** Change to first-person quote: "I thought I'd never feel like myself again. Then I discovered The Longevity Reset."

**4. Generic FAQ Questions**
- **Current:** "Will this actually work for me?" "Will I be able to stick to it?"
- **Issue:** Defensive, doubt-inducing questions
- **Recommendation:** Reframe to empowering questions: "How quickly will I see results?" "What makes this different from other programs I've tried?"

## Image Strategy Issues

### Current Image Problems:

**1. Placeholder/Generic Images**
- **Issue:** The 6 topic boxes use generic medical/wellness stock photos
- **Impact:** Looks like every other health website
- **Recommendation:** Replace with custom graphics or remove section entirely (recommended)

**2. Video Thumbnail Placeholders**
- **Issue:** Two "video" thumbnails that don't actually play
- **Impact:** Damages credibility when users click and nothing happens
- **Recommendation:** Remove until real videos are available

**3. Missing Lifestyle Photography**
- **Issue:** No aspirational lifestyle images showing the "after" state
- **Recommendation:** Add 2-3 images of vibrant, energized midlife women (exercising, socializing, confident portraits)

**4. Victoria's Photos**
- **Status:** GOOD - professional and consistent
- **Action:** Keep current images
