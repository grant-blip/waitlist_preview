## 🔧 ISSUES TO FIX

### Hero Image
❌ **PRIORITY 1: Hero image looks drab and lifeless**
- Image appears flat, low contrast
- Background is too muted (beige/cream)
- Victoria's image lacks vibrancy and energy
- Needs: brightness boost, contrast enhancement, color saturation

### Visual Consistency
❌ Placeholder video thumbnails in testimonials section
❌ Generic "As Featured In" logos may be placeholders
❌ Check if all images are optimized and high-quality

### Missing Marketing Elements
❌ No exit-intent popup to capture abandoning visitors
❌ No email capture for those not ready to buy
❌ No live chat or support option visible
❌ No money-back guarantee mentioned
❌ No scarcity indicator beyond "33 spots left"

### CTA Optimization
⚠️ Multiple CTAs but no clear hierarchy
⚠️ "Reserve Your Spot Now" could be more benefit-driven
⚠️ Consider: "Yes, I Want to Feel Vibrant Again" or "Claim My Spot Now"

### Social Proof
⚠️ Testimonial videos appear to be placeholders
⚠️ Could add more specific transformation stories
⚠️ Consider adding real-time registration notifications
